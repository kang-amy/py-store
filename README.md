# py-store

Py-Store is a Python replica of a Redis cache database! Py-Store uses RAM to store database information allowing for quicker retrieval times. 

This program supports the Redis commands SET, GET and DEL. To use Py-Store clone the repository and run it using python main.py. To perform queries/actions you can use any Redis client, telnet or nc. I recommend using redis-cli!
